# Creating-relations-in-SQLite

In this guided project, we will walk through how to normalize our single table into multiple tables and how to create relations between them.
We'll work on a database created previously in this project:
    - [Preparing data for SQLite](https://github.com/dominick87/Preparing-data-for-SQLite)

You'll find the database within the project folder.
